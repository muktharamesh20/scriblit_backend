In the realm of theoretical physics, quantum entanglement is a phenomenon
where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the
same fate, regardless of the distance separating them. This means that
measuring the quantum state of one entangled particle instantly influences
the state of its partner, even if they are light-years apart. Albert Einstein
famously referred to this as "spooky action at a distance." This concept
challenges classical notions of locality and has profound implications for
our understanding of reality, paving the way for technologies like quantum
computing and quantum cryptography. The measurement problem in quantum mechanics
is closely related, questioning when and how a quantum superposition
collapses into a definite state.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms
that can learn and make decisions from data. There are three main types: supervised
learning (learning from labeled examples), unsupervised learning (finding patterns
in data without labels), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error
with rewards and penalties). Popular algorithms include linear regression, decision
trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. The field has applications in
image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous
vehicles. Key challenges include overfitting, bias in training data, and the need
for large amounts of data to train effective models.
