**Folder[Item, User]**  
- **Purpose:** Organize items hierarchically  
- **Principle:** After you create a folder and insert elements into it, you can move the folder into another folder and all the elements still belong to it.  You can insert folders or items inside a folder.
- **State:** 
    - Set of Folders with 
        - title String
        - an owner User
        - a contained set of Folders
        - an elements set of `Item`
- **Actions:** 
    - `initializeFolders(u: User): (f: Folder)`
        - **requires** the user `u` has created no other folders
        - **effect** creates a root folder to nest elements and folders inside of that the user owns
    - `createFolder(u: User, title: String, parent: Folder): (f: Folder)`
        - **requires** `parent` exists and has owner `u`
        - **effect** creates a folder with title `title` that is a child of the folder `parent`
    - `moveFolder(f1: Folder, f2: Folder)`
        - **requires** f2 is not hierarchcly a descendent of f1.  In other words, f2 cannot be inside of f1 through any path of folders.  Both folders must have the same owner.
        - **effect** if f1 is already in a folder, remove it from that folder and move it into f2.  If f1 is a new folder, just add it to f2.
    - `deleteFolder(f: Folder)`
        - **effect** deletes f and everything contained inside of f from the folder hierarchy 
    - `insertItem(i: Item, f: Folder)`
        - **effect** if i is already in a folder, remove it from that folder and insert it into f.  Otherwise, simply insert it into f
